# starterBook

KickStarter is a massive crowdfunding service which over 300,000 projects launched on it, only a third of them have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.
Using the Excel table provided, I modifyed and analyzed the data of four thousand past Kickstarter projects as to uncover some of the market trends. I Used conditional formatting to fill a three-color scale. Created few new sheets with a pivot table and stacked column pivot chart.
Please check the excel sheet.
